(Verse 1)

Waking up to the sound of rain,

A blurry view through the window pane,

Coffee’s cold, and the day drifts slow,

Just me and my thoughts, nowhere to go.


(Chorus)

Feeling lonely in the sunshine,

Lost in the glow, but the warmth ain't mine,

Smiles from strangers, passing by,

But I chase the shadows, watch the clouds sigh.


(Verse 2)

Pictures hang on my faded wall,

Memories whisper, but I can't recall,

Sipping tea while the world moves on,

I’m a ghost in a dream that feels so wrong.


(Chorus)

Feeling lonely in the sunshine,

Lost in the glow, but the warmth ain't mine,

Smiles from strangers, passing by,

But I chase the shadows, watch the clouds sigh.


(Bridge)

Maybe one day, I'll find a friend,

Until then, I’ll just pretend,

Dancing with echoes, humming a tune,

In this empty room, I’m a solitary moon.


(Chorus)

Feeling lonely in the sunshine,

Lost in the glow, but the warmth ain't mine,

Smiles from strangers, passing by,

But I chase the shadows, watch the clouds sigh.


(Outro)

So here I linger, with a heart out of tune,

Alone in the sunlight, singing to the moon.

Fading like the moment, in a world so unkind,

Just a soul wandering, with love left behind.
